# Revisiting Differential-Linear Attacks via a Boomerang Perspective

This repository will soon contain the source code of the tools we utilized in our paper [Revisiting Differential-Linear Attacks via a Boomerang Perspective With Application to AES, Ascon, CLEFIA, SKINNY, PRESENT, KNOT, TWINE, WARP, LBlock, Simeck, and SERPENT](https://ia.cr/2024/255) which has been accepted to [CRYPTO 2024](https://crypto.iacr.org/2024/).

I am polishing the code and making it more user-friendly before publicly publishing it. 
If you are eager to have access to the code earlier, please contact me at hsn.hadipour@gmail.com.
